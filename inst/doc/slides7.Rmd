# 7.1 Introduction

##  7.1 Introduction

  * The `ff` (fast file) package provides access to data stored on your hard desk
    * Data isn't stored in memory
    * Bigger data sets!
  * It allows efficient indexing, retrieval and sorting of vectors 
    * But hard drive is slower than RAM
    
##  Introduction

  * No longer loading data directly into memory
    * Non-standard R code
  * The `ff` package __only__ provides the building blocks
    * Few statistical functions
    * No support for characters. 

##  Introduction

  * The `ffbase` package extends `ff`
    * `c()`, `duplicated()` and `which()`
  * The successor to `ffbase` is currently available on github 
    * Integrate `ff` with `dplyr`

## 7.2 Importing data

  * The `ff` package provides a number of functions to read in data. 
  * All the `read.*` base R functions have `ff` equivalents that are used in the same way. 

## Importing data

  * There are two key classes in the `ff` package. `ff` for vector and `ffdf` for data frames.
  * To illustrate we'll use a simple csv file

    ```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    library("ff")
    ## `get_rand()` Returns the full path
    filename = nclRbig::get_rand()
    ffx = read.csv.ffdf(file=filename, header = TRUE)
    ```

## Some standard functions

  * We can use (some) standard R functions to query the data set.

    ```{r, results="hide"}
    ## Only 10000 rows (small) 
    dim(ffx)
    ```
  * But not all
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    colSums(ffx) # produces the following error:
    
    ## Error in colSums(ffx) : 'x' must be an array ...
    ```

# Exercise 1 chapter 7
## Exercise 1 chapter 7
```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("ff", package="nclRbig")
```

# 7.3 Data chunks
## 7.3 Data chunks

  * The key idea with `ffdf` objects, is that we no longer manipulate objects in one go
    * Use chunks of data. 
  * Split the data set up into smaller pieces that can be manipulated by R
    * Process them one-by-one. 
  * The `ff` package is a much more efficient solution than the naive approach of manually splitting your data into separate files, and using numerous `read.csv` calls.

## Data chunks

  * The `chunk` function creates a sequence of range indexes using a syntax similar to `seq`.
  * Since this data set is small, we only have a single chunk
    ```{r}
    length(chunk(ffx))
    ```

## Data chunks

  * To make this section more realistic we'll manually specify the number of chunks using the `length.out`. 
  * The `chunk` function returns a list of ranges
    ```{r}
    chunk(ffx, length.out=10)[[1]]
    ```

## Data chunks

  * Since we are now dealing with chunks, this makes standard data analysis a pain. 
  * For example, suppose we just want to find the minimum value of the matrix. 
  * If `ffx` was a standard data frame, we would just use `min(ffx)`. 
  
## Data chunks
  
  * However, `ffx` isn't a standard R object. 
  * Instead, we need to loop over the chunks and keep track of the result, e.g.

    ```{r tidy=FALSE}
    m = numeric(10)
    chunks = chunk(ffx, length.out=10)
    for(i in seq_along(chunks))
      m[i] = min(ffx[chunks[[i]],])
    min(m)
    ```

# Exercise 2 chapter 7
## Exercise 2 chapter 7
```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("chapter7", package="nclRbig")
```
## Pass by reference

  * Since we are dealing with out of memory objects, standard rules about copying objects no longer apply
  * In particular when we copy objects, we are passing by reference

## Pass by reference

  * When we change `ffy`

    ```{r}
    ffy = ffx
    ffy[1, 1]  = 0
    ```
  * we have also changed `ffx`

    ```{r}
    ffx[1, 1]
    ```

It's a trade off between large objects and side-effects.  

## ff vs readr

  * At this point it's worthwhile thinking about speed comparisons with `readr`, via a quick benchmark. 
  * First we create a test data set

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    r4bd::create_rand("example.csv", 1e6)
    ```

## ff vs readr

Then time reading in the files
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
system.time(ffx <- ff::read.csv.ffdf(file="/tmp/tmp.csv", header = TRUE))
system.time(x <- readr::read_csv("/tmp/tmp.csv"))
```

## ff vs readr

  * On my machine, the `readr` function is an order of magnitude faster. 
    * This is what we would expect. 
  * The `ffdf` version is also preparing the data for future read/write access from the hard drive
  * Also, the `readr` variant is limited by your RAM
  * So if your file is too large, you will get an error

    ```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
    R> x = readr::read_csv("very_big.csv")
    # Error: cannot allocate vector of size 12.8 Gb
    ```


## 7.3.1 ff Storage

  * When data is the `ff` format, processing is faster than using the standard `read.csv`/`write.csv` combination. 
  * However, converting data into `ff` format can be time consuming; so keeping data in `ff` format is helpful. 
  * When you load in an `ff` object, there is a corresponding file(s) created on your hard disk

    ```{r} 
    filename(ffx)
    ```

## ff Storage

  * This make moving data around a bit more complicated. 
  * The package provides helper functions, `ffsave` and `ffload`, which zips/unzips `ff` object files. 
  * However the `ff` files are not platform-independent, so some care is needed when changing operating systems.

# 7.4 The ffbase package
## The ffbase package

  * The `ff` package supplies the tools for manipulating large data sets, but provides few statistical functions. 
  * Conceptually, chunking algorithms are straightforward. 
  * The program reads a chunk of data into memory, performs intermediate calculations, saves the results and reads the next chunk. 
  * This process repeats until the entire dataset is processed. 
  * Unfortunately, many statistical algorithms have not been written with chunking in mind.
  
## The ffbase package

  * The `ffbase` package adds basic statistical functions to `ff` and `ffdf` objects.
  * It tries to make the code more R like and smooth away the pain of working with `ff` objects. 
  * It also provides an interface with `big*` methods.

## The ffbase package

  * `ffbase` provides S3 methods for a number of standard functions
    * `mean`, `min`, `max`, and standard arithmetic operators  for `ff` objects
    * See `?ffbase` for a complete list
  * This removes some of the pain when dealing with `ff` objects. 

## The ffbase package

  * The `ffbase` package also provide access to other packages that handle large data sets
    * `biglm`: Regression for data too large to fit in memory;
    * `biglars`: Scalable Least-Angle Regression and Lasso.
    * `bigrf`: Big Random Forests: Classification and Regression Forests for Large Data Sets.
    * `stream`: Infrastructure for Data Stream Mining.

# 7.5 Big linear models
## 7.5 Big linear models

  * Linear models (lm) are one of the most basic statistical models available. 
  * The simplest regression model is 
\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
\]
where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. 
  * This corresponds to fitting a straight line through some points. 
  * So $\beta_0$ is the  $y$-intercept and $\beta_1$ is the gradient. 
  * The aim is to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

## Big linear models

  * In the more general multiple regression model, there are $p$ predictor variables
\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i, 
\]
where $x_{ij}$ is the $i^\text{th}$ observation on the $j^\text{th}$ independent variable.


## Big linear models

The above equation can be written neatly in matrix notation as
\[
Y = X \beta + \epsilon
\]
with dimensions
\[
[n\times 1]= [n\times (p+1)] ~[(p+1)\times 1] + [n \times 1 ]\;,
\]
where

  * $Y$ is the response vector - (dimensions $n \times 1$)
  * $X$ is the design matrix - (dimensions $n \times (p+1)$)
  * $\beta$ is the parameter vector - (dimensions $(p+1) \times 1$)
  * $\epsilon$ is the error vector - (dimensions $n \times 1$)

## Big linear models

The goal of regression is to estimate $\beta$ with $\hat\beta$. 
\begin{equation}
\hat\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y.
\end{equation}
Our estimate of $\hat \beta$ will exist provided that $(X^T X)^{-1}$
exists, i.e. no column of $X$ is a linear combination of other columns.

## Big linear models

For a least squares regression with a simple size of $n$ training examples and $p$ predictors, it takes:

 * $O(p^2n)$ to multiply $X^T$ by $X$;
 * $O(pn)$ to multiply $X^T$ by $Y$;
 * $O(p^3)$ to compute the LU (or Cholesky) factorization of $X^TX$ that is used to compute the product of $(X^TX)^{-1} (X^T Y)$.

## Big linear models

  * Since $n >> p$, this means that the algorithm scales with order $O(p^2 n)$. 
  * As well as taking a long time to calculate, the memory required also increases. 
  * The R implementation of `lm` requires $O(np + p^2)$ in memory.
  * But this can be reduced by constructing the model matrix in chunks. 


## Big linear models

  * It works by updating the Cholesky decomposition with new observations. 
  * So for a model with $p$ variables, only the $p \times p$ (triangular) Cholesky factor and a single row of data needs to be in the memory at any given time. 
  * The `biglm` pack age does not do the chunking for you, but `ffbase` provides a handy S3 wrapper, `bigglm.ffdf`.

For an example of using `biglm`, see the blog post at \url{http://goo.gl/iBPkTp} by Bnosac.
